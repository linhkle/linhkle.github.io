#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Political Science and the School of Global Policy and Strategy, University of California San Diego. 

My research examines the dynamics of contemporary state building in ethnically diverse peripheral regions. I explore the extent to which government policies like internal migration and minority language education can facilitate the incorporation of ethnic minorities into the state, and when they might induce backlash. I use a variety of empirical methods leveraging geospatial, text, and archival data, focusing on Vietnam and Southeast Asia.
